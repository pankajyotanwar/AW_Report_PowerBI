# AW_Report_PowerBI
This project helped me develop advanced data modeling, dashboard design, and business intelligence skills.

Steps i followed:
1. transforming data
 Transformed raw data with the help of data query editor and tools in data tab(table tools, column tools and made sure each able serves a single, distinctive purpose.
 
2. Data modelling 
 Carefully established one to many relationships between lookup tables and data tables in relationship tab to reduce redundancy and preserve data integrity.

3. DAX ( data analysis Expressions)
  Created useful formula based calculated columns for filtering data and measures for aggregation and various other functions (statistical, logical, text, date & time, iteration, etc)

4. Adding Visuals
 Created 3 different pages ( Executive summary, Product details and Customer details).
 Used simple yet powerful interactive visuals to generate insights ( such as matrix, cards, slicers, treemaps, line chart, KPI's, etc).
